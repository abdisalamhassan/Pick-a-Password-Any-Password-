# Password Generator Starter Code

## Goal 
User needs a a new, secure password
When the user clicks the "Generate" button the goal is to generate a password
The user will then be presented with a series of prompts for password criteria("would you like lowercase?" "Would you like uppercase?" etc)
The user will then select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN user will then chose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
The user will will then be asked for character types to include in the password
The user will then confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
After the user answers each prompt
Then the user input will be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
